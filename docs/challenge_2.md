# **Step 2: Network Scanning**
!!! note ""

- Run a basic scan to check the Network:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="11"
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(hcoco1„âøkali)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ$ ip addr                                                       
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:39:98:6e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.223/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 84939sec preferred_lft 84939sec
    inet6 2600:1700:1580:4b60::26/128 scope global dynamic noprefixroute 
       valid_lft 2142sec preferred_lft 2142sec
    inet6 2600:1700:1580:4b60:8291:bf25:fefb:aca5/64 scope global temporary dynamic 
       valid_lft 3514sec preferred_lft 3514sec
    inet6 2600:1700:1580:4b60:a00:27ff:fe39:986e/64 scope global dynamic mngtmpaddr noprefixroute 
       valid_lft 3514sec preferred_lft 3514sec
    inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fe39:986e/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

```

  >Based on the output  provided from  `ip addr` command, we can see that the Kali Linux machine is configured with the IP address `192.168.1.223` on the `eth0` interface, and it's within the `/24` subnet. 


- Identify which hosts are up in the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet, you can start with a ping sweep using Nmap. This is a non-intrusive way to discover active hosts.

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="28"

‚îî‚îÄ$ nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

>Now that you have identified the target VM, you can perform more in-depth scan on the IP addresses. The goal here is to discover which services are running on the target VM and to identify any potential vulnerabilities associated with these services. 

- Next, run service and version detection scans on the specific IP addresses found in your first scan.¬†Scan for services beginning at port 1 and ending at port 5000.

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="11"
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ$ 
nmap -sV -p1-5000 192.168.1.226

Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-06-25 05:40 EDT
Nmap scan report for unknownf2a4540f4500.attlocal.net (192.168.1.226)
Host is up (0.0072s latency).
Not shown: 4997 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT    STATE  SERVICE    VERSION
22/tcp  closed ssh
80/tcp  open   tcpwrapped
443/tcp open   tcpwrapped

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 34.72 seconds

```

The Nmap scan results show that most ports are filtered (no-response), and the only open ports are 80 (http) and 443 (https), but they are reported as tcpwrapped, and port 22 (ssh) is closed.

'tcpwrapped' generally means that the service running on the port is protected by TCP wrappers and the server is not providing any information about the service. This can be due to security measures that limit the visibility of services to unauthorized scanners.

To gather more information, we can try the following:

Use the --reason option to understand why ports are reported as they are.

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="10"
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(hcoco1„âøkali)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ$ sudo nmap -sV -p1-5000 --reason 192.168.1.226

```

The updated Nmap scan results indicate that ports 80 and 443 are open and running Apache HTTPD, while port 22 (SSH) is closed. This suggests that the web server on the target machine might be a potential entry point for further investigation.
