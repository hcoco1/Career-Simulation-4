## Ethical Hacking - Overview

Penetration testing is like a thorough security checkup for computer systems. Testers simulate hacker activities to find and fix vulnerabilities before attackers can take advantage of them. This practice is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of digital systems.

This project is of utmost importance as it aims to conduct a thorough web penetration test using the Mr. Robot Virtual Machine, which simulates realistic web vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. This setup allows for the exploration and documentation of potential security flaws without impacting real systems.

Each step, finding, and the overall result will be meticulously documented. This website will provide a detailed account of the methodology and outcomes of the penetration testing journey, offering insights into the process of security assessments and underscoring the importance of regular security maintenance to prevent cyber attacks. Remember, penetration testing is not just a task, it's a crucial practice for maintaining the integrity and security of digital systems.
